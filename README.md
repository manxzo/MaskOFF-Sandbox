## Overview

MASKoff is designed to reduce bias in the hiring process while offering a robust platform for job seekers and employers alike. With integrated real‑time messaging (AES‑encrypted) and a dynamic feed of job posts, users can build personalized profiles and engage in professional networking and job-related transactions—all in one place.

---

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**

  - JWT‑based authentication with secure password hashing (bcrypt)
  - Email verification and password reset flows via MailerSend

- **Profile Management**

  - **User Authentication Schema:**  
    Manages user credentials, tokens (for email verification and password reset), and friend relationships (using a friend sub‑schema with userID and username).  
    _Registration requires: First Name, Last Name, Email, Username, Date of Birth, Password, Repeat Password, and Anonymous Identity._
  - **User Profile Schema:**  
    Stores additional profile details such as bio, skills, achievements, and portfolio. These fields are optional and can be set during onboarding.

- **Jobs**

  - All posts are job‑related. Each job post falls under one of two categories:
    - **#Service:** For individuals offering freelance services.
    - **#Job:** For posting job positions (full‑time/part‑time) or recruitment opportunities.
  - **Application Process:**  
    Job posters create posts with details such as title, description, price/salary range, and contract period. Potential applicants click an **Apply/Request** button that sends an automated greeting to the job poster (e.g., “Hi [Job Poster], I am interested…”) and triggers a toast notification.
  - **Job Tracker:**  
    A dedicated tracker page (in development) will display each job post with all its details—even if the original post is later removed from the main feed—and will include action buttons to progress through the hiring process (such as Approve/Decline, Mark as Completed/Abandoned). Both job posters and applicants can use the tracker alongside ongoing chat for further communication.

- **Direct Messaging**

  - Real‑time chat with AES‑encrypted messages via WebSocket notifications.
  - Enables ongoing communication regarding job applications and additional details.

- **Friend Management**
  - Send, accept, or reject friend requests.
  - View and manage a consolidated friend list.

## Schema Details

1. **UserAuth Schema**  
   _Purpose:_ Manage user credentials, friend relationships, and token data.  
   **Key Fields:**

   - First Name, Last Name (currently combined into a single `name` field)
   - Email, Username, Date of Birth
   - Password (and confirmation during registration)
   - Anonymous Identity
   - Arrays for friendRequestsSent, friendRequestsReceived, and friends (using a sub‑schema with userID and username)
   - Tokens for email verification and password resets

2. **UserProfile Schema**  
   _Purpose:_ Store additional profile details for onboarding and ongoing personalization.  
   **Key Fields (optional during onboarding):**
   - Bio, Skills, Achievements, Portfolio
   - Privacy flag to toggle between MaskON (anonymous) and MaskOFF (public) modes
   - Anonymous Info containing the Anonymous Identity (used when the user opts for MaskON)

---

## User Flow

1. **Registration:**

   - **User Create:**  
     The registration form (based on the UserAuth schema) requires First Name, Last Name, Email, Username, Date of Birth, Password, Repeat Password, and Anonymous Identity.
   - **Onboarding:**  
     After registration, users are directed to an onboarding page where they can optionally add profile details (bio, skills, achievements, portfolio) via the UserProfile schema.
   - **Navigation:**  
     Once onboarding is complete, users are taken to their profile page.

2. **Social & Friend Features:**
   - Users can search for and add friends.
   - A friend list and friend request system allow users to manage their network.

---

## Job Process & Tracker

- **Job Posting:**  
  Job posters create job posts with details such as title, description, price/salary range, contract period, and select a job category (either **#Service** or **#Job**).

- **Application:**  
  Potential applicants click the **Apply/Request** button on a job post. This action sends an automated greeting to the job poster and triggers a toast notification, while also adding the job post to the applicant’s tracker.

- **Job Tracker:**  
  A tracker page (currently outlined in the documentation) will:
  - Display the details of each job post (persisted even if removed from the main feed)
  - Allow job posters to approve or decline applications and to mark a job as Completed or Abandoned
  - Allow applicants to accept or decline job offers and view the current status of their applications
  - Update the status in real time; if a job is completed, the applicant’s completed jobs are listed on their profile under “Completed Jobs”

---

## Profile Settings & Page

**Display-Only Information:**

- First Name, Last Name
- Email
- Username
- Date of Birth

**Editable Fields:**

- Change Password (with confirmation)
- Bio
- Skills
- Achievements
- Portfolio (with upload capability)
- Profile Toggle (MaskON / MaskOFF to switch between public and private views)
